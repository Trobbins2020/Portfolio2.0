      This is Home. --- Hello! My name is Talon Robbins, and I'm a Software Engineer!  ..Well, I'm LEARNING to be a Software Engineer through Thinkful Bootcamp. I love this so far! My motivations are things such as Financial Independence, Stability and a way to fuel my Acting career, among a few personal reasons/motives. I am looking forward to becoming an asset in the tech industry!

        <section id="about">
        This is About. --- As briefly stated in the Home/Intro section, I am a film Actor. I started that journey 6 years ago and never looked back! I have starred or co-starred in almost all my gigs, with the exception of my first gig. I am also a vocalist! I have been a singer for 14+ years now, and I am looking forward to starting a YouTube channel for Vocal Covers! I am also a gamer when I'm not doing anything else, I've been gaming since I was 4 years old! Want to know how I stumbled into the tech industry? Well, one day I wanted to join the group 'Anonymous', and needed to teach myself code, so I started with HTML but needed to find a free resource to do so, and found W3Schools.com! This was just as it was starting out, and HTML was all they offered. Now they offer nearly everything! I found Thinkful via Facebook advertising, and checked it out for a few weeks before trying it out. I passed my tests and here I am! 
        This is going to be fun!
